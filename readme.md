# Calculadora de Tiempo (Time Calculator)

**TimeCalculator** (calculadora de tiempo) is a very simple NVDA add-on focused on agility and simplicity.

## Objective

Calculate the time remaining between the system time and a time selected by the user.

## Use cases

- Need to know how much time is left to go to sleep? Drop down the plugin, enter the time you are going to sleep, and press the calculate button. The plugin will return a voice output and copy it to the clipboard: "12 hours and 57 minutes to go".
- Need to know how long until lunch?

## How to use

When installing the add-on, press the key shortcut **NVDA + alt + t** and it will display the interface with 2 combo boxes (hour and minute) and 2 buttons with their keyboard shortcuts:

- **Calculate** - button - Alt + c
- **Exit** - button - Alt + s

The shortcut to display the plug-in window is customisable under the Time Calculator category in input gestures.

## Changelog
